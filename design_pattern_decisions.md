# Design Patterns

The ideal of a decentralised game trading platform is to allow buyer and seller
to freely trade second hand games through our smart contract, without needing to
trust a middle man. The smart contract act as the "middle mam" instead of the
traditional model.

Our smart contract had built in features such as:

## Inter-Contract Execution

We had imported OpenZepplin's contract library here in our smart contract.

## Inheritance and Interfaces

Importing and extending contracts and/or using contract interfaces

## Access Contract Design Patterns

estricting access to certain functions using things like Ownable, Role-based
Control
