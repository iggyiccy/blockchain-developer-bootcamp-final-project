## Decentralised Game Trading Marketplace

I recently bought a Nintendo Switch game console and found that it is a common
struggle for console owners to buy and sell pre-owned games. This project aims
to provide a decentralised solution for the game trading space.

Features:

- Smart contract lock-in deposit for shipping related trade
- Smart contract lock-in deposit for F2F trading
- Smart contract for local business owners to register become a trading site
- Smart contract to rate selling and buyer
- Use Chainlink Oracle to fetch information from Australia Post shipping details
- Use Chainlink Oracle to fetch Nintendo game price and details
- Organise F2F meetup
- Decentralised chat feature using Status
